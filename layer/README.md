# React App with Layer Architecture
This is a layered architecture, which is designed to separate the application's codebase into different layers. The layers are organized based on their responsibilities, and each layer communicates only with the layers immediately above and below it.

## Project structure

src/
|-- assets/
|   |-- fonts/
|   |-- i18n/
|-- components/
|   |-- button/
|   |   |-- Button.tsx
|   |   |-- StyledButton.ts
|-- configs/
|   |-- api/
|   |-- axios/
|   |   |-- index.ts
|-- interfaces/
|   |-- dashboard.ts
|-- redux/
|   |-- actions/
|   |   |-- dashboard.ts
|   |   |-- index.ts
|   |-- reducers/
|   |   |-- dashboard.ts
|   |-- types/
|   |   |-- dashboard.ts
|   |-- index.ts
|-- routes/
|   |-- index.tsx
|-- services/
|   |-- dashboard.ts
|-- utils/
|-- views/
|   |-- Dashboard.tsx
|-- App.tsx

### assets/
This directory contains all the static assets used in the application, such as fonts and i18n (internationalization) files.

### components/
This directory contains all the reusable UI components used in the application. In this case, there is a "button" component that includes a Button.tsx file for the component logic and a StyledButton.ts file for the styling.

### configs/
This directory contains all the configuration files used in the application. There are subdirectories for the API and axios configurations, which include an index.ts file for exporting the configurations.

### interfaces/
This directory contains all the interfaces used in the application. In this case, there is a "dashboard" interface for defining the structure of the data used in the dashboard.

### redux/
This directory contains all the files related to Redux, a popular state management library for React. There are subdirectories for actions, reducers, and types, as well as an index.ts file for exporting everything.

### routes/
This directory contains all the routing logic for the application. In this case, there is an index.tsx file that defines the routes for the application.

### services/
This directory contains all the services used in the application. In this case, there is a "dashboard" service that handles all the API requests related to the dashboard.

### utils/
This directory contains all the utility functions used in the application.

### views/
This directory contains all the views or pages of the application. In this case, there is a "Dashboard" view that displays the dashboard data.

### App.tsx
This is the entry point of the application, which renders the main component and sets up the routing.

# Responsibility

## Presentation Layer:
The **components** and **views** that make up the user interface.

## Business Logic Layer: 
The layers responsible for processing business logic, such as **services**, **redux**, **actions**, and **reducers**.

## Data Access Layer: 
The layers responsible for data access, such as **configs**, **axios**, and **API**.

## Benefits
The layered architecture has several benefits, including:

### Separation of Concerns
The layered architecture separates the different concerns of the application into different layers, making it easier to develop, test, and maintain the code.

### Scalability
The layered architecture is designed to be scalable, allowing new layers to be added as the application grows and new features are added.

### Flexibility
The layered architecture is flexible, allowing developers to swap out different components or layers without affecting the rest of the application.

### Testability
The layered architecture makes it easier to write unit tests, as each layer can be tested independently of the others.

## Conclusion
The layered architecture is a flexible and scalable approach to organizing an application's codebase. By separating the different concerns of the application into different layers, it makes it easier to develop, test, and maintain the code over time.
